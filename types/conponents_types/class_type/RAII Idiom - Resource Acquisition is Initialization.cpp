	Notes : 

	Implication 1: C++ programming language does not require the
	garbage collector!!
	Implication 2 :The programmer has the responsibility to manage
	the resources
	RAII Idiom consists in three steps:
		• Encapsulate a resource into a class (constructor)
		• Use the resource via a local instance of the class
		• The resource is automatically releases when the object gets
		out of scope (destructor)
