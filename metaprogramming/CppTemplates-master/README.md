# C++ example source codes

The syntax of certain C++ constructs can quickly become complicated. This is especially the case of template metaprogramming: the error outputs of the compiler can be very cryptic, and the syntax differences between a working program and a non-compiling program can be very slimâ€¦

Those examples are meant to help myself (and others?) to recall the syntax of such C++ constructs.

## How to use

From the root run e.g.

    me@host$ ./compileAndRun.sh examples/templateMetaProgramming/functionTemplates/basics_templateSpecialization.cpp
